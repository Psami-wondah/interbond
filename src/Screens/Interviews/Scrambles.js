          <h3>POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS IN ABIA</h3>
          <p>
            If these last four groups merge to become one in future, according
            to the sources they are going to give the ANC in the state a good
            fight as the latter is seen as being centered round an individual.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, both the NUC, PDA, CNC, NCN and, NPM have proclaimed
            themselves in Abia as being progressive, and may not quarrel much
            over nomenclature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, all the groups are mobilizing at the grassroots for the
            October 1 broadcast of General Sani Abacha which would unfold the
            expected transition program. Sources close to the NCN in abia
            indicated that a number of its members may already have set-up their
            independent machinery to contest the partyâ€™s gubernatorial seat.

            Among them are a Lagos based industrialist Chief Sony Nlewedim from
            Umuawa, Umuahia Urban and Chief Chidi Onwumere, former sole
            Administrator of the Modern Ceramics Industries limited; who hails
            from Olokoro, the same home with Prince Vincent Eze Oghlafor of the
            PDA who also has the same ambition.
